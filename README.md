1. Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page. This will create a copy of this repository in your account.
2. Now clone the forked repository to your machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the copy to clipboard icon.
3. Open a terminal and run the following git command:
      ```
      git clone "url you just copied"
      ```
   where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.
   For example:
      ```
      git clone https://github.com/your_username/WHILE_APP.git
      ```
4. Now create a branch using the 'git switch' command in repository directory:

      ```
5. Make necessary changes and commit those changes. Add those changes to the branch you just created using the 'git add' command:

      git add .
      ```
    Now commit those changes using the 'git commit' command:
      ```
      git commit -m "Add your title here"
      ```
6. Push your changes using the command git push:
      ```
      git push -u origin your-branch-name
      ```
      replacing your-branch-name with the name of the branch you created earlier.
